## Sentiment Analysis with Neural Networks

This is the sixth project for AI for Trading Nanodegree.

In this project, 
- I shall build a deep learning model to classify the sentiment of messages from StockTwits, a social network for investors and traders. 
- The model will be able to predict if any particular message is positive or negative. 
- From this, I shall generate a signal of the public sentiment for various ticker symbols.
